This app is an admin panel that allows to set and manage the water availablity schedules of all the Algerian wilayas (districts) and their respective towns. The app was created as a result of a drastic decrease in rainfaill rates that has led to the cease of continuous 24h/7d water supply in my country. This situation made it difficult to tell the exact time at which the water is restored or cut as well as to plan for any tasks involving water usage.

Therefore, the objective of this app is to offer a tool to set and adjust water availabilty schedules data that can be accessed through an Android/iOS app, which is a related project available in this [repository](https://github.com/medcheck/water-schedule-app).
